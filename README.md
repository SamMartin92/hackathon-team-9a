## APIs:

- In this project, an API from [every.org](https://www.every.org/) was used for the Find An NGO page.
- This API allows users to find an API based on the cause they select. 

## Wireframes:
Wireframes were designed by [Ant](https://github.com/Ant2210) created using figma.

- A test was conducted on the response of each url and passed. See screenshot below:

![Tests](static/readme/tests.PNG)

- Encountered a postgres error
  which did not allow us to progress with any further testing within the timeframe allowable for the hackathon so manual testing was employed instead for th rest of the project. Error below

## Deployment

- This site was developed in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- It was built using the Django framework.
- The site was developed by previewing the site in the browser through Port 8000 in Gitpod by running the command ```python manage.py runserver``` in the terminal. Changes and entries to the workspace were then committed and pushed to this Github repository.
### Setting up the project in Gitpod workspace:
1. Install django by running the following command ```pip3 install Django```
2. Install gunicorn for running the deployed website ```pip3 install gunicorn```
3. To install postgres to support the database ```pip3 install dj_database_url pyscopg2```
4. Install any other required libraries by running similar commands and add them to a requirements.txt file so that Heroku will install them at deployment. This is done by running ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements``` in the terminal and can be run again when necessary to add further libraries.
5. Create your Django project by entering the following command: ```django-admin startproject < YOUR PROJECT NAME >```
6. To create a django app, run ```python manage.py startapp < YOUR APP NAME >```
7. Add the name of the newly created app to "INSTALLED_APPS" in settings.py.
8. Development of apps can begin from here.
### Deploying to Heroku
1. Once logged into Heroku, choose the option 'Create App'.
2. Attach the database in the Resources tab in Add-ons. Search for 'Heroku Postgres' and add.
3. In your workspace, create an env.py file which will store environment variable and add it to .gitignore so as not to expose any sensitive information publicly in Github.
4. Store your 'SECRET_KEY' and 'DATABASE_URL' here and import into settings.py
5. In Heroku, under settings, choose 'Reveal Config Vars and add your 'SECRET_KEY' and 'DATABASE_URL'.
6. Migrate to the database in Gitpod using ```python manage.py makemigrations``` followed by ```python manage.py migrate```
7. Add your Heroku app URL to "ALLOWED_HOSTS" in settings.py.
8. Create a Procfile in the top level of the directory and add ```web: gunicorn projectname.wsgi``` so Heroku knows how to run the project.
### Initial deployment:
1. Push any changes to Github after connecting your Heroku app to your repository.
2. Add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC with a value of 1 to Heroku config vars.
3. Select Github in Deployment method and choose 'Deploy branch' under Manual Deploy, ensuring your main branch is chosen.
4.  Remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC config var.
5. Change DEBUG to False in settings.py
6. Push changes and deploy.
