                    non-profit, charitable trust,

                <li class="mt-3"><b>Develop a board of directors:</b> Establish a board of directors to govern your NGO
                    and oversee its activities.
                    Choose individuals who are passionate about your mission and have the skills and experience needed
                    to help
                    your organization succeed.</li>
                <li class="mt-3"><b>Develop a strategic plan:</b> Create a strategic plan that outlines your NGO's goals
                    and objectives, as well as

                <li class="mt-3"><b>Secure funding:</b> Identify potential sources of funding, such as grants,

                <li class="mt-3"><b>Build a team:</b> Hire staff and volunteers who share your passion and can help you
                    achieve your NGO's goals.

                <li class="mt-3"><b>Establish partnerships:</b> Build partnerships with other organizations, including
                    government agencies,
                    non-profits, and businesses, to expand your reach and impact.</li>
                <li class="mt-3"><b>Launch your programs:</b> Launch your programs and services, and track your progress
                    towards your goals.
                    Continuously assess your organization's impact and make adjustments to your strategies as needed to
                    ensure
                    long-term success.</li>
